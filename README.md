## Welcome

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home). I have finished my doctoral [thesis](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-02962587v2/document#:~:text=The%20basic%20idea%20is%20to,PH%20as%20the%20initial%20one.) under the supervision of [Jean-Daniel Boissonnat](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Jean-Daniel.Boissonnat/). I did my undergraduate studies from the Department of Mathematics (Mathematics and Computing) at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/siddharthpritam/siddharthpritam.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
